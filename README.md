# TextFunk Plugin for Obsidian

## How to Use It:
Each function is registered as a command in the Obsidian editor. You can trigger them either via the command palette or assign a keyboard shortcut for quick access. It doesn't work with multiple cursors.

## Command List:
1. **Join Lines**: Joins selected lines into one, replacing newlines with a space.
2. **Remove Empty Lines**: Removes all empty lines from selected text, or the entire document if nothing is selected.
3. **Remove Consecutive Empty Lines**: Collapses multiple consecutive empty lines into a single empty line in the selected text or entire document.
4. **Trim Leading and Trailing Spaces**: Removes unnecessary leading and trailing spaces from each line in the selection, or from all lines in the document if nothing is selected.
